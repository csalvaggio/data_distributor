# data_distributor - A Web-Visible Data Distribution Module

Create random slug-based directories for web-visible data distributions.
  
The class is responsible for creating unique slug-based directories within
a base directory, building corresponding public URLs, and optionally
generating an `index.html` file for each created distribution. It can also
fetch a remote HTML template to use for index generation.
